MamaBot answer:
 Spitting up is common in infants, especially in the first few months of life, and is often due to their immature digestive systems. It's generally considered normal if your baby is gaining weight, seems happy, and is feeding well. However, you should consult a pediatrician if your baby is spitting up forcefully, has blood in the spit-up, is not gaining weight, or shows signs of dehydration. If you're ever in doubt, it's best to seek professional advice.
